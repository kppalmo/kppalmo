Computer Science Graduate, Ithaca College (2023) | Master's Candidate at RIT in Computer Science

I'm Keegan Palmo, a passionate and dedicated computer science professional who graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Ithaca College in 2023. Currently, I am furthering my expertise in the field by pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).

My academic journey has been marked by a strong commitment to learning and innovation. At Ithaca, I honed my skills in software development, data structures, and algorithmic problem-solving, preparing myself for the complex challenges of the tech industry. Now at RIT, I am expanding my knowledge base, focusing on advanced topics like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics.

I am particularly interested in applying my computer science skills to develop solutions that make a significant impact in the tech world. Whether working on individual projects or collaborating in team settings, I bring a blend of technical proficiency, creative thinking, and a keen eye for detail.

**Some Languages I've worked with:**
- Java
- Python
- C
- C++
- JS/HTML/CSS

- mongoDB
- Flask/Django

### Some Projects I've worked on: ###


###### waitChex ######
waitChex is a full stack web application fully developed by myself and my college roommate to accurately estimate average waiting times for dining halls across campus. Using a combination of custom build hardware, backend databases, and hosting, we are able to deliver this information and spread it across campus for students to easier plan accordingly. The system is built off of Queuing Theory, and uses live Real Time databases for fast and correct updates.
- Built whole front/back end system (React, FireBase RTD)
- UI / UX development  (HTML, CSS, Styled Components, JS)
- Testing servers, database, and hosting across software

###### PAR System ######
The PAR (Practice, Assessment, Review) system is an Intelligent Tutor based web application giving students easier access to practice / review material from class. Using quick feedback, clean visuals, and strong data, the system is able to produce and accurately show each individual students understanding of topics and material. Also showing areas of struggle, and progression.Â 
- Worked on front end / UI / UX development (React, JS, HTML, CSS)
- Implemented progress tracking component and visuals (React, JS, HTML, CSS)

###### Localify ######
Web based application using local data and data collected via Spotify to support local music artist's using intelligent based playlist creation and music recommendations.
- Senior Dev Ops (Handle DB Backups, Technical Computer Work)

### Other Work: ###
- Teaching Assistant for Intro to Computers Course (17100)
- Director of Outreach Ithaca College Computer Science Club
