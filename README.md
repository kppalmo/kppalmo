###### waitChex ######
waitChex is a full stack web application fully developed by myself and my college roommate to accurately estimate average waiting times for dining halls across campus. Using a combination of custom build hardware, backend databases, and hosting, we are able to deliver this information and spread it across campus for students to easier plan accordingly. The system is built off of Queuing Theory, and uses live Real Time databases for fast and correct updates.
- Built whole front/back end system (React, FireBase RTD)
- UI / UX development  (HTML, CSS, Styled Components, JS)
- Testing servers, database, and hosting across software

###### PAR System ######
The PAR (Practice, Assessment, Review) system is an Intelligent Tutor based web application giving students easier access to practice / review material from class. Using quick feedback, clean visuals, and strong data, the system is able to produce and accurately show each individual students understanding of topics and material. Also showing areas of struggle, and progression.Â 
- Worked on front end / UI / UX development (React, JS, HTML, CSS)
